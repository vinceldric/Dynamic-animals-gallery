#### Assets
- used the instructor's [starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/assessments/tree/master/cpnt262/assignment-2/starter).
- used this [guide](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/) on using CSS Grid for the gallery.

#### Short Summary
Using the starter code given by our [instructor](https://github.com/acidtone) is a huge help on constructing the Dynamic Animals Gallery page. I've also looked up some of our activities that are related on galleries and using CSS files. I've also reused some of the codes on importing `custom modules` on JavaScript file and using `array.forEach` and `loops`.
